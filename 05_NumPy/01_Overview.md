### **NumPy Lecture Summary**

**1. What is NumPy?**

* NumPy (pronounced “Num-Pie”) is a **linear algebra library for Python**.
* It is **crucial for data science** because most Python data libraries (like pandas, SciPy, and scikit-learn) depend on it.
* NumPy is **very fast** due to bindings with C libraries.
* It allows working efficiently with **arrays (vectors and matrices)**.

**2. Installation of NumPy:**

* **Recommended:** Use the **Anaconda distribution** of Python to simplify installation and handle dependencies.

  * Install via terminal/command prompt:

    ```bash
    conda install numpy
    ```
* **Alternative:** If not using Anaconda, install via pip:

  ```bash
  pip install numpy
  ```

**3. NumPy Basics:**

* The main data structures are **NumPy arrays**:

  * **Vectors** → 1-dimensional arrays
  * **Matrices** → 2-dimensional arrays (can also be a single row or column)
* NumPy arrays will be used throughout the course for **mathematical operations and data manipulation**.

**4. Key Points to Remember:**

* NumPy is foundational for **scientific computing in Python**.
* Always prefer **Anaconda for installation** if possible.
* Focus on understanding **vectors and matrices** in NumPy.

**5. **Why use NumPy:**

* Essential for **data manipulation, math, and linear algebra**
* Building block for libraries like **pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn**

**6. **Usage Tip:**

* Always work with **NumPy arrays**, not plain Python lists, for performance
