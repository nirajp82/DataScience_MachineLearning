Got it 👍 — here’s a **general-purpose README.md** (no mention of lectures), written like proper documentation:

# Anaconda Virtual Environments

Anaconda provides a built-in environment manager, making it easy to create and manage **isolated Python environments**.
Virtual environments allow you to work with multiple versions of Python and libraries without conflicts.

---

## 📌 What Are Virtual Environments?

* A **virtual environment** is an isolated installation of Python and packages.
* Benefits:

  * Maintain multiple Python versions side by side.
  * Use different versions of libraries for different projects.
  * Prevent package conflicts by keeping dependencies separate.
  * Easily activate or deactivate environments.

---

## 📌 Why Use Virtual Environments?

* Run projects that depend on different **library versions** (e.g., `scikit-learn 0.27` vs `0.20`).
* Work with both **Python 2.7** and **Python 3.x** on the same machine.
* Keep your **base environment clean** while testing or developing in separate environments.

---

## 📌 Creating Virtual Environments with Conda

### 1. Create a New Environment

```bash
conda create --name fluffy numpy
```

* `--name fluffy` → names the environment *fluffy*
* `numpy` → installs NumPy when creating the environment

---

### 2. Activate and Deactivate

```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate fluffy

# Deactivate environment
conda deactivate
```

When activated, the environment name appears in parentheses before the command prompt.

---

### 3. Install Packages into an Environment

```bash
conda install pandas
```

This installs **pandas** only in the currently active environment.

---

### 4. Create an Environment with a Specific Python Version

```bash
conda create --name mypython3 python=3.5 numpy
```

* Creates environment `mypython3` with **Python 3.5** and NumPy.
* To install the full Anaconda distribution instead:

  ```bash
  conda create --name mypython3 python=3.5 anaconda
  ```

---

### 5. List All Environments

```bash
conda info --envs
```

Example output:

```
base                  *  /Users/username/anaconda3
fluffy                   /Users/username/anaconda3/envs/fluffy
mypython3                /Users/username/anaconda3/envs/mypython3
```

The `*` marks the active environment.

---

## 📌 Additional Commands

* **Clone an environment**

  ```bash
  conda create --name newenv --clone fluffy
  ```
* **Remove an environment**

  ```bash
  conda remove --name fluffy --all
  ```

---

## 📌 Best Practice

* Use a dedicated environment per project.
* Example for a data science project:

  ```bash
  conda create --name mydatascience python=3.9 numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
  ```
